<strong>Artist Statement</strong>
<p>I believe that every structure has a story to tell.  Structures embody the achievements, 
the failures and the dreams of the women and men that built them.  Degrading buildings 
offer a rich history of what was while new construction offers insight into what will be.  
Society is documented by what it has built.  The story is captured there in the bricks, 
the wood and the concrete.  When I draw, I am telling that story.

<p>
When I was very young my Dad worked for the railroad. He was gone a lot, but
whenever he was home we spent time building a model railroad set in our basement. We
called it “Appletown” and eventually it grew into a very detailed miniature city. What
that model offered me was a chance to experience a version of the world my Dad
worked in that as a child I had no other way of experiencing or comprehending. That
idea is still with me today.
</p>
<p>
In truth a model is a very incomplete representation of the real world. It is so
singularly focused that it is unable to capture all of the complexities of life. Yet
within that focus something amazing happens – distractions like emotion, cancer,
prejudice and taxes are removed. Creation of a model inherently forces dissociation
from actual reality, but simultaneously allows for a more intimate experience with an
alternate version of reality.
</p>
<p>
This idea of modeling reality is the conceptual basis of my art. From there a
building process occurs during which I extend the model through a variety of ways
(imagination, research, personal experience, etc.) creating a more complete way of
depicting location. Instead of just visually recreating or documenting a location, my
aim is to specifically alter the way that location is experienced through my image.

<strong>Artist Bio</strong>
<p>
I live in Minneapolis, a city that offers no end of interesting architecture.  Historic 
buildings, new construction, or even just the old bar up the street,
I will never run out of material to draw from.
